# Heart_disease_Classification_project

This project involves all the necessary steps that a machine learning model goes through, from collecting data to evaluating the model. 

The problem definition of this project is to train a classification model to predict whether a person has heart disease or not depending on their medical attributes. 

The steps that are involved in this project are:

1.Problem definition	
2.Data	
3.Evaluation	
4.Feauters	
5.Modelling	
6.Experimenting	

In step 1:

  As the name implies, we will define what exactly we are going to solve through this project, that is classification of heart-disease.
  
In step 2:

  We will collect the data from online sources.
  
In step 3:

 This indicates, how much accuarcy we are targeting for.
 
In step 4:

  We will explore the features and their correlations.
  
In step 5:

  In this step, we will import few number of classification models and train and test them with the data. And we will draw accuracy scores of the models.

In step 6:

  In this, we will try to improve accuracy of a model by hypertuning the models. This step includes all
  
      Hyperparameter tuning
	  
      Feature importance
	  
      Confusion matrix
	  
      Cross validation
	  
      Precision
	  
      Recall
	  
      F1 score
	  
      Classification report
	  
      ROC curve
	  
      Area under curve(AUC)
      
NOTE: We can stop the experiment step, if we get the desired accuracy in the first attempt itself. (Probably, the goal of accuracy would be 95% or above)
